# Windows11_CalendarWidget
Minimal calendar app displays schedule from Google Calendar API.

## 1. Motivation
I couldn't find a good enough solution to display the schedule of classes I planned in Google Calendar. I wanted to create a widget that is similar, to those available on smartphones.

## 2. How it works?
App displays 10 recent activities from calendar. <br/>

<br/>
You can click calendar icon on the tray to open settings or close application.<br/>

<br/>
Right now only a few options are customizable. You can change: dimensions and position of a window. Additionaly you can logout, update events and disable/enable startup.<br/>
